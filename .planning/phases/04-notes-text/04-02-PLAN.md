Start the frontend development server for manual testing:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Confirm server starts without errors on http://localhost:5173 (or configured port).

Note: Backend should also be running for full sync testing. If not running:
```bash
cd backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

  <what-built>
Phase 4: Notes and Text functionality including:
- Sticky notes with 8 color options (yellow, pink, blue, green, orange, purple, lavender, white)
- Standalone text objects
- Inline editing (double-click to edit, click away to save)
- Note color persistence across sessions
- Aspect-locked note resize (stays square)
- Subtle Post-it shadow on notes
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Open the canvas at http://localhost:5173 and perform these tests:

**1. Sticky Notes (TEXT-01)**
- [ ] Click the Note tool in toolbar (looks like a square with corner fold)
- [ ] Click on canvas to create a sticky note
- [ ] Verify note appears as colored square with subtle shadow
- [ ] Verify note has default yellow color
- [ ] Double-click note to enter edit mode - cursor should blink
- [ ] Type some text, click away to save
- [ ] Verify text is saved and visible on note

**2. Note Colors (TEXT-01)**
- [ ] Select a note, open color picker in toolbar
- [ ] Change color - verify at least 4-6 distinct colors available
- [ ] Verify color changes immediately on selected note
- [ ] Create a new note - should use the last selected color
- [ ] Refresh the page (F5)
- [ ] Create another note - should still use the persisted color

**3. Note Resize**
- [ ] Select a note and drag resize handles
- [ ] Verify note stays square (aspect-locked)
- [ ] Verify text reflows/scales appropriately

**4. Text Objects (TEXT-02)**
- [ ] Click the Text tool in toolbar (looks like "T" or text icon)
- [ ] Click on canvas to create text object
- [ ] Start typing immediately (should auto-focus)
- [ ] Click away to save
- [ ] Verify standalone text appears without note background

**5. Inline Editing (TEXT-03)**
- [ ] Single-click on existing note - should SELECT (not edit)
- [ ] Double-click on existing note - should enter EDIT mode
- [ ] Verify cursor blinks, can edit text
- [ ] Click away from note - should EXIT edit mode and save
- [ ] Same behavior for text objects

**6. Real-time Sync (if backend running)**
- [ ] Open canvas in two browser windows
- [ ] Create note in window 1 - appears in window 2
- [ ] Edit note text in window 1 - changes sync to window 2
- [ ] Change note color in window 2 - syncs to window 1

**Note:** tldraw's default toolbar (DefaultToolbar) includes Note and Text tools automatically. If they're missing, that indicates an integration issue.
